           Compilation

Makefile  may need adjustment !
This will not run on a non-elf platform
You need libxpm and libdl, I got them from sunsite.unc.edu.

Those messages (especially for modules) are OK.
They should come from struct GoodyLoadable declared inside
the modules.

          Installation

Put the modules (*.so files) in some nice directory, 
/var/X11R6/lib/fvwm95-2/plugins is recommended.

A corresponding piece of fvwmrc is in EXAMPLE.fvwmrc
A speaker icon is supplied, the plug icon should be
among the icons that came with fvwm

          Running
FvwmTaskBar prints the names of all loaded modules on stdout.
You can read them in .xsession-errors .
