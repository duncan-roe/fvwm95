NOTE: this version of fvwm95 is hacked even further. The taskbar has been
modified and some new modules are included. Also the system.fvwm95rc has
been heavily modified and commented. The man pages have been mostly updated
and converted to html format. Some settings (background, focus ...) can
be saved automaticaly using the 'screen setup' and 'desktop setup' entries
in the 'Settings' menu.
