	* Fixed return type of 'main' in modules (must be 'int').

	* Applied the stacking order patch from ??

	  This patch changes three things:

          1. FVWM now keeps track of window stacking order:

	  First, it makes FVWM keep track of the stacking order of the
	  windows, by using a second set of chain pointers (the original
	  chain keeps track of the order in which windows have been focused,
	  which is often not the same as the stacking order). So now FVWM
	  can easily answer the question "who's on third?" at any time (and,
	  since the new chain is closed into a ring anchored at both ends on
	  Scr.FvwmRoot, it can tell you who's third from the bottom as
	  quickly as who's third from the top).

	  2. Reversal of window stacking order when FVWM restarts:

	  Second, by using this new-found knowledge, FVWM will reparent
	  windows back to the root window (on a Restart or a Recapture
	  operation) in the reverse of the current stacking order. This
	  eliminates the old quirk of having the stacking order appear more
	  or less reversed after restarting FVWM.

	  3. Smoother, faster page/desk transition

	  Third, it restructures the the Desktop and Viewport (page)
	  switching routines to perform a simultaneous bidirectional loop
	  through the window list (via the new stacking order chain).
	  Windows that are moving off the visible screen are unmapped/moved
	  from the bottom of the stacking order upwards. Windows that are
	  moving onto the visible screen are mapped/moved from the top down.

	  The intent is to minimize the amount of expose/redraw overhead
	  during these operations when there are a number of overlapping
	  windows involved.  It also serves to equalize the visual
	  disturbance between the moving-out and the moving-in operations. 
	  Previously, moving out of a page/desktop with many overlapping
	  windows could be disturbing and slow because, as the windows moved
	  from the top down, the ones underneath got redrawn as they were
	  exposed. Moving into such a page/desktop, on the other hand, would
	  appear quick and smooth because, as the upper windows appeared
	  first, the underlying portions of the subsequently mapped/moved
	  windows didn't need to get drawn.

	  Now, if you never have any overlapping windows on your desktop,
	  you won't see any improvement from this. If you only occasionally
	  have a couple of overlapping windows, you might not notice any
	  difference. But if you have several windows that overlap
	  significantly, the transition to or from the page where they are
	  should be very noticeably quicker and smoother.
