</ul><H2>NAME </H2><ul>

FvwmTalk - the FVWM command line interface

</ul><H2>SYNOPSIS </H2><ul>

FvwmTalk is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

<p>
</ul><H2>DESCRIPTION </H2><ul>

The FvwmTalk allows the user to type fvwm commands into a window, and
have them executed immediately. These commands are usually specfified
in the .fvwmrc file, or are bound to menu/mouse items as specified
in that file. This tools is particularly useful for testing new
configuration ideas, or for implementing temporary changes to your
environment.

interfacing this module to the Window Manager, are all original work

</ul><H2>INITIALIZATION </H2><ul>

So kill me, I can't remember what goes on.

<p>
</ul><H2>INVOCATION </H2><ul>

FvwmTalk can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module FvwmTalk' in
the .fvwmrc file. This can be placed on a line by itself, if FvwmTalk
is to be spawned during fvwm's initialization, or can be bound to a
menu or mouse button or keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm will search
directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt
to locate FvwmTalk.
