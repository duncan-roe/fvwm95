FvwmConsole - the FVWM command input interface

</ul><H2>SYNOPSIS </H2><ul>

FvwmConsole is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.
From within the .fvwm2rc file or from a menu, FvwmConsole takes any
options xterm will take, except -e, -name, and -title.

<p><ul>Module FvwmConsole -g 40x10 -fg black -bg green3
</ul>
<p>Also X resources can be set in .Xdefaults file

</ul><H2>DESCRIPTION </H2><ul>

The FvwmConsole allows the user to type fvwm commands into xterm, and
have them executed immediately. These commands are usually specfified
in the .fvwmrc file, or are bound to menu/mouse items as specified
in that file. This tools is particularly useful for testing new
configuration ideas, or for implementing temporary changes to your
environment.

<p>GNU readline library is called to edit command line.
Also a perl script is supplied as alternative command editor. Its
commands are similar to emacs.

</ul><H2>INVOCATION </H2><ul>

FvwmConsole can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module FvwmConsole' in
the .fvwmrc file. This can be placed on a line by itself, if FvwmConsole
is to be spawned during fvwm's initialization, or can be bound to a
menu or mouse button or keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm will search
directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt
to locate FvwmConsole.

<p>
</ul><H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS </H2><ul>

FvwmConsole uses xterm. All resources set for xterm are inherited
unless overiden by command line options.
