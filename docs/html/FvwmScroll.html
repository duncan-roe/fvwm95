</ul><H2>NAME </H2><ul>

FvwmScroll - the FVWM scroll-bar module

</ul><H2>SYNOPSIS </H2><ul>

FvwmScroll is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

<p>
</ul><H2>DESCRIPTION </H2><ul>

The FvwmScroll module prompts the user to select a target window, if
the module was not launched from within a window context in Fvwm.
After that, it adds scroll bars to the selected window, to reduce the
total desktop space consumed by the window.

<p>
<p>FvwmScroll reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when it starts up,
and looks for lines similar to "*FvwmScrollFore green".

<p>FvwmScroll should not be used with windows which move or resize
themselves, nor should it be used with windows which set the
WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property. Operation is fine with windows that have
a private colormap.

<p>
</ul><H2>COPYRIGHTS </H2><ul>

The FvwmScroll program, and the concept for
interfacing this module to the Window Manager, are all original work
by Robert Nation.

<p>Copyright 1994, Robert Nation. No guarantees or
warranties or anything 
are provided or implied in any way whatsoever. Use this program at your
own risk. Permission to use this program for any purpose is given,
as long as the copyright is kept intact. 

<p>
<p>
</ul><H2>INITIALIZATION </H2><ul>

During initialization, <i>FvwmScroll</i> will eventually search a 
configuration file which describes the colors to use.
The configuration file is the same file that fvwm used during initialization.

<p>If the FvwmScroll executable is linked to another name, ie ln -s
FvwmScroll MoreScroll, then another module called MoreScroll can be
started, with a completely different configuration than FvwmScroll,
simply by changing the keyword  FvwmScroll to MoreScroll.

<p>
</ul><H2>INVOCATION </H2><ul>

FvwmScroll can be invoked by binding the action 'Module
FvwmScroll x y' to a menu or key-stroke in the .fvwmrc file.
The parameter x and y are integers, which describe the horizontal and
vertical window size reduction.
Fvwm will search
directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt
to locate FvwmScroll. Although nothing keeps you from launching
FvwmScroll at start-up time, you probably don't want to.

<p>
</ul><H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS </H2><ul>

FvwmScroll reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when it starts up,
and looks for lines as listed below:

<p><p><dl compact><dt>*FvwmScrollFore <i>color</i><dd>Tells the module to use <i>color</i> instead of grey for scroll bars 
themselves.

<p><dt>*FvwmScrollBack <i>color</i><dd>Tells the module to use <i>color</i> instead of black for the window
background.

<p></dl>
</ul><H2>BUGS </H2><ul>

When the scroll bars are removed by clicking on the button in the
lower right corner, the window does not restore its location
correctly.
