FvwmDebug - the FVWM module debugger

</ul><H2>SYNOPSIS </H2><ul>

FvwmDebug is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

<p>
</ul><H2>DESCRIPTION </H2><ul>

The FvwmDebug captures the stream of module packets coming from
fvwm, and displays them on stderr.

<p>
</ul><H2>COPYRIGHTS </H2><ul>

The FvwmDebug program, and the concept for
interfacing this module to the Window Manager, are all original work
by Robert Nation

<p>Copyright 1994, Robert Nation. No guarantees or warranties or anything
are provided or implied in any way whatsoever. Use this program at your
own risk. Permission to use this program for any purpose is given,
as long as the copyright is kept intact. 

<p>
<p>
</ul><H2>INITIALIZATION </H2><ul>

During initialization, the FvwmDebug requests that fvwm dump a
complete window list into its pipe. These packets are terminated with
and "end Send_WindowList" message.

<p>
</ul><H2>INVOCATION </H2><ul>

FvwmDebug can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module FvwmDebug' in
the .fvwmrc file. This can be placed on a line by itself, if FvwmDebug
is to be spawned during fvwm's initialization, or can be bound to a
menu or mouse button or keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm will search
directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt
to locate FvwmDebug.

<p>
</ul><H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS </H2><ul>

There are no configuration options.
