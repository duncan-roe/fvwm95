</ul><H2>NAME </H2><ul>

FvwmSaveDesk - another FVWM desktop-layout saving module

</ul><H2>SYNOPSIS </H2><ul>

FvwmSaveDesk is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

<p>
</ul><H2>DESCRIPTION </H2><ul>

When called, this module will attempt to save your current desktop
layout as a fvwm function definition into the file
<i>.fvwmdesk</i> 
in your home directory. The function is named
<i>StartupFunction</i> 
. This Function can be called in Function
<i>InitFunction</i> 
to startup all Programms on all Workspaces.
If fvwm is compiled with the M4 option, you can include this file in
<i>.fvmrc</i> 
else you have to insert this file by hand.
Your applications must supply certain hints to the X window system.
Emacs, for example, does not, so FvwmSaveDesk can't get any
information from it.  
 
Also, FvwmSaveDesk assumes that certain command line options are
globally accepted by applications, which may not be the case.

<p>
</ul><H2>SETUP IF FVWM IS COMPILED WITH THE M4 OPTION </H2><ul>

Fvwm has to be called with the option

<p>-m4opt -I$HOME.

<p>The first line in .fvwmrc should be

<p>undefine(`include`),

<p>to avoid problems.
You can the include the file
<i>.fvwmdesk</i> 
with 

<p>sinclude(`.fvwmdesk') .

<p>Insert the following line into the Function
<i>InitFunction</i> 

<p>Function "I"    StartupFunction

<p>If you have GNU's m4 another possiblity is to compile fvwm with
GNU_M4_OPTION_P and use

<p>m4_include(`.fvwmdesk')m4_dnl

<p>So you don't need to undefine `include'.

<p>
</ul><H2>INVOCATION </H2><ul>

FvwmSaveDesk can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module FvwmSaveDesk' in
the 
<i>.fvwmrc</i> 
file.
This should be bound to a menu or mouse button or keystroke
to invoke it later. Fvwm will search directory specified in the ModulePath
configuration option to attempt to locate FvwmSaveDesk.
