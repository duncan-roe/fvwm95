FvwmBacker - the FVWM background changer module

</ul><H2>SYNOPSIS </H2><ul>

FvwmBacker is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

<p>
</ul><H2>DESCRIPTION </H2><ul>

The FvwmBacker module provides functionality to change the background
when changing desktops.  Any command can be executed to change the
backgrounds.  The commands used to change the backgrounds must exit
after changing the root window, (i.e. 'xv -root zzz.gif' does not,
without the -quit option) otherwise FvwmBacker will hang.

<p>
</ul><H2>COPYRIGHTS </H2><ul>

The FvwmBacker module is the original work of Mike Finger.

at your own risk.  You may freely use this module or any portion of it
for any purpose as long as the copyright is kept intact.

<p>
</ul><H2>INITIALIZATION </H2><ul>

During initialization, <i>FvwmBacker</i> will scan the same
configuration file that FVWM used during startup to find the options
that pertain to it.  These options are discussed in a later section.

<p>
</ul><H2>INVOCATION </H2><ul>

FvwmBacker can be invoked by fvwm during initialization by inserting
the line 'Module FvwmBacker' in the .fvwmrc file.

<p>FvwmBacker must reside in a directory that is listed in the ModulePath
option of FVWM for it to be executed by FVWM.

<p>
</ul><H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS </H2><ul>

The following is the only supported option at present:

<p><p><dl compact><dt>*FvwmBackerDesk <i>DeskNumber command</i><dd>Specifies the <i>command</i> to execute when the specified
<i>DeskNumber</i> becomes active.

<p>If the command begins with <i>-solid</i> FvwmBacker uses the next
argument as a color in the X database and sets the background to that
color without generating a system call to xsetroot. Only single word
color names may be used.
