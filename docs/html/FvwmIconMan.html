FvwmIconMan - an Fvwm Icon Manager

</ul><H2>SYNOPSIS </H2><ul>

FvwmIconMan is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

<p>
</ul><H2>DESCRIPTION </H2><ul>

FvwmIconMan is an icon manager modeled after the TWM icon manager. 
The user may have multiple icon managers, each of which are armed with a list
of window types which it manages. For example, the user may have one manager
which lists only emacs windows, and another which lists everything else. You
may also specify what resolution each icon manager uses, for example, one
icon manager may manage windows on all desks, and another may manage only 
those on the current desk, or page.

<p>Unlike the TWM icon manager, FvwmIconMan is limited in only having the icons 
listed vertically. Also unlike the TWM icon manager, it sports a three 
dimensional look (when the display depth is sufficient). 

<p>You may bind fvwm functions to mouse buttondown events, and to the event 
where the mouse enters one of the buttons. For example, you could bind the
first mouse button to the Iconify function, and the second mouse button to
the Identify function.

<p>FvwmIconMan can be set to display which window currently has the keyboard
focus, and by binding the select event (see below) to the fvwm Focus function,
you can emulate the TWM icon manager's behavior. Unfortunately, the Focus
function warps the cursor to the target window. This FvwmIconMan distribution
includes a patch to fvwm 2.0.41 which modifes the behavior of Focus so that
it takes an argmument to control whether or not it warps the cursor.

<p>
</ul><H2>INITIALIZATION </H2><ul>

During initialization, FvwmIconMan searches though the fvwm configuration file
for the options which are described below. It is highly recommended that you
make FvwmIconMan be a sticky window. And if you want to make use of the 
followfocus option, and/or binding an action to Focus, then you should make
FvwmIconMan clicktofocus.

<p>
</ul><H2>INVOCATION </H2><ul>

FvwmIconMan can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module FvwmIconMan' in the .fvwmrc file. If FvwmIconMan is to be spawned during fvwm's initialization,
then this line should be placed in the InitFunction and ResetFunction
declarations, or it can be bound to a menu, mouse button, or keystroke to
invoke it later. FvwmIconMan should be placed in the ModulePath (defined in
the .fvwmrc file) in order for fvwm to find it.

<p>
</ul><H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS </H2><ul>

With the exception of the nummanagers option, all of the options may be
defined on a per-manager basis. So, for example, the user may have his emacs
manager with a red foreground, and his xterm manager with a blue one. A
configuration line may therefore have one of two forms:

<p><p><dl compact><dt>*FvwmIconMan*optionname optionvalue<dd>To specify that the <i>optionname</i> takes the value <i>optionvalue</i> 
for all managers.
<dt>*FvwmIconMan*managerid*optionname optionvalue<dd>To specify that the option <i>optionname</i> takes the value <i>optionvalue</i>
for manager <i>managerid</i>.

<p>The following options may be specified:

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*nummanagers <i>num</i><dd><i>num</i> is a positive integer specifying the total number of icon managers.
Since FvwmIconMan would like to know how many managers there are before
handling any manager specific options, this should come first. Default is 1.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]resolution <i>resolution</i><dd>Specifies when the manager will display an entry for a certain
window. <i>resolution</i> may take one of the following values: global, desk,
or page. If global, then all windows of the appropriate type (see the show
and dontshow options below) will be shown. If desk, then only those windows 
on the current desk will be down. And if page, then only those windows on the 
current page will be shown. Default is global.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]showtitle <i>boolean</i><dd>If <i>true</i>, then print the window title names in the
manager, if <i>false</i>, then print the icon names. Default is false.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]font <i>font</i><dd>Specifies the font to be used for labeling the buttons.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]geometry <i>geometry</i><dd>Specified the geometry of the manager. If the geometry is specified with a 
negative y coordinate, then the window manager will grow upwards. Otherwise,
it will shrink downwards.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]foreground <i>foreground</i><dd>Specifies the default foreground color.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]background <i>background</i><dd>Specifies the default background color.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]plainbutton <i>style</i> [<i>forecolor</i> <i>backcolor</i>]<dd>Specifies how normal buttons look. <i>style</i> may be one of <i>flat</i>,
<i>up</i>, or <i>down</i>, and describes how the button is drawn. The
color options are both optional, and if not set, then the default
colors are used. If on a monochrome screen, then the <i>style</i> option is
ignored, but must still be set.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]selectbutton <i>style</i> [<i>forecolor</i> <i>backcolor</i>]<dd>Same as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of buttons when the
mouse is over them.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]focusbutton <i>style</i> [<i>forecolor</i> <i>backcolor</i>]<dd>Same as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of buttons whose
windows have the keyboard focus.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]focusandselectbutton <i>style</i> [<i>forecolor</i> <i>backcolor</i>]<dd>Same as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of buttons which are
both selected, and have the keyboard focus.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]action <i>event</i> <i>response</i>[,<i>response...</i>]<dd>Tells FvwmIconMan to send the commands in <i>response</i> to fvwm when 
<i>event</i> is done. <i>Event</i> may take on one of the values: select, 
click1, click2, or click3. Default is iconify for all three buttons and nop 
for select.  Select refers to the cursor entering a button in the manager.

<p>The two following options control which windows get handled by which
managers. A manager can get two lists, one of windows to show, and one of
windows to ignore. If only the <i>show</i> list is given, then that manager
will show only the windows in the list. If only the <i>dontshow</i> list is
given, then the manager will show all windows except those in the list. If
both lists are given, then a window will be shown if it is not in the
<i>dontshow</i> list, and in the <i>show</i> list. And finally, if neither list
is given, then the manager will handle all windows. Each list is made up of
patterns of the form <i>type=pattern</i>, where type is one of <i>class</i>,
<i>resource</i>, <i>title</i>, or <i>icon</i>, and pattern is a regular
expression of the same format used in the fvwm style command. Quotes around
the pattern will be taken as part of the regular expression. If a window could
be handled by more than one manager, then the manager with the lowest id gets 
it.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]show <i>pattern list</i><dd>If a window matches one of the patterns in the list, then it may be handled
by this manager.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]dontshow <i>pattern list</i><dd>If a window matches one of the patterns in the list, then it may not be
handled by this manager.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]followfocus <i>boolean</i><dd>If <i>boolean</i> is <i>true</i>, then the button appearance reflects
which window currently has focus.  Default is false.

<p><dt>*FvwmIconMan*[id*]sort <i>boolean</i><dd>If <i>boolean</i> is <i>true</i>, then the icon manager is kept sorted. Default
is true.

</ul><H2>SAMPLE CONFIGURATION </H2><ul>

This first example is of a the simplest invocation of FvwmIconMan, which only
has one manager, and handles all windows:

<p>This example is my personal configuration. It has two managers, one for emacs
and one for everything else, minus things with no icon title. Only windows on
the current page are displayed. Notice the argument to Focus in the select
action. This only works if you apply the included patch for fvwm. A nonzero
argument to focus, or no argument results in Focus warping the cursor to the
target window, and the value of 0 makes Focus not warp the cursor. Note how
the geometry and show options are specified per manager, and the others are
common to all:

<p>
</ul><H2>UNFINISHED BUSINESS </H2><ul>

There is one bug that I know of. A honest to goodness solution to this would
be appreciated. When an icon manager is set to grow upwards, on some machines
it may wander occasionally.

<p>When a manager is in page resolution, and the page is switched, the manager
updates the windows after every fvwm event comes in, causing it to rapidly
grow and shrink until it finally settles into the new configuration. This
doesn't happen when in desk resolution.

<p>It doesn't handle windows without resource names as gracefully as it should.
