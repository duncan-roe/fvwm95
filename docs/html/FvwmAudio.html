<b>FvwmAudio</b> - the FVWM Audio module

</ul><H2>SYNOPSIS </H2><ul>

<b>FvwmAudio</b> is spawned by <b>fvwm</b>, so no command line invocation will 
work.  From within the <i>.fvwmrc</i> file, <b>FvwmAudio</b> is spawned as 
follows:
<pre>

<p>
Module FvwmAudio 
<br>
<p>

or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:

</ul><H2>DESCRIPTION </H2><ul>

The <b>FvwmAudio</b> module communicates with the Fvwm window manager
to bind audio sounds to window manager actions.  Different audio
queues may be assigned to any window manager action.  <b>FvwmAudio</b>
can be used with any independent audio player, and therefore requires
no special audio library APIs of its own.  Simple in its design, it
merely binds the audio filenames to particular actions and forks off
the audio player program with the appropriate filename when that
action occurs.

<p><b>FvwmAudio</b> can also have builtin support for the rplay library.

<p>
</ul><H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS </H2><ul>

<b>FvwmAudio</b> reads the same <i>.fvwm2rc</i> file as <b>fvwm(1)</b>
reads when it starts up, and looks for certain configuration options:

<p><p><dl compact><dt>*FvwmAudioPlayCmd <i>/usr/bin/X11/demos/auplay</i><dd>This determines the independent audio player program that will
actually play the sounds.  If the play command is set to
<i>builtin-rplay</i> then the builtin rplay support will be used.  For
example:
</dl>
<p>
*FvwmAudioPlayCmd <i>builtin-rplay</i>

<p><p><dl compact><dt>*FvwmAudioDir <i>/usr/lib/sounds</i><dd>Specifies the directory to look for the audio files.  This option is
ignored when rplay is used.

<p><dt>*FvwmAudioDelay <i>5</i><dd>Specifies that sound events will only be played if they occur at least
5 seconds after the previous event.  Sounds events that occur during
the delay period are ignored.  This option is useful if you don't want
several sounds playing at the same time.  The default delay is 0 which
disables the audio delay.

<p><dt>*FvwmAudioRplayHost <i>hostname</i><dd>Specifies what host the sounds will play on.  The <i>hostname</i> can
also be an environment variable such as $HOSTDISPLAY.  This option is
only valid with builtin rplay support.

<p><dt>*FvwmAudioRplayPriority <i>0</i><dd>Specifies what priority will be assigned to the sounds when they are
played.  This option is only valid with builtin rplay support.

<p><dt>*FvwmAudioRplayVolume <i>127</i><dd>Specifies what volume will be assigned to the sounds when they are
played.  This option is only valid with builtin rplay support.

<p><dt>*FvwmAudio <i>window-manager_action audio_filename</i><dd>Binds particular window manager actions to sound queues.

</ul><H2>INVOCATION </H2><ul>

The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section. No command
line invocation is possible. <b>FvwmAudio</b> must be invoked by the
<b>fvwm</b> window manager.

<p>

</ul><H2>BUGS </H2><ul>

It's REALLY noisy when fvwm starts and restarts.

<p>

</ul><H2>COPYRIGHTS </H2><ul>

This module is heavily based on a similar Fvwm module called
<b>FvwmSound</b> by Mark Boyns. <b>FvwmAudio</b> simply takes Mark's
original program and extends it to make it generic enough to work with
any audio player. The concept for interfacing this module to the
Window Manager, is original work by Robert Nation.
